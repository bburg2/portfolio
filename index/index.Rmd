# About me

Hi, my name is Bas and I made a website for showing my skill in working with different programming languages, these languages include R, SQL and bash.
I made a few pages for showing my different types of skills. I also uploaded my resume to my website.
I will keep updating this page for future usage and for tracking how I develop new skill in working with programming or other types of skills like paragliding.
